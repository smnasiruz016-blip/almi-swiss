// Build-time COUNTRIES-AXIS GATE.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — two real bugs, both shipped to production, that every other
// check in this repo passed:
//
//  1. SELF-ORIGIN. src/data/seo/countries.json listed Switzerland itself, so the
//     matrix advertised "Study in Switzerland from Switzerland". almi-dutch and
//     almi-icelandic had the identical bug. axes.ts even carried the comment
//     "origins only (Sweden excluded)" — the label was localized, the fact was
//     not, which is this lineage's signature failure.
//
//  2. A MISSING COUNTRY — found 2026-07-15. Portugal was absent from EVERY fork
//     in the countries.json lineage. This file descends from almi-portuguese,
//     which created it on 2026-07-10 and correctly dropped PT as its own self;
//     dutch (07-11), icelandic (07-12), danish/norwegian/swedish (07-14) all
//     inherited that copy, where PT is a perfectly legitimate origin. Result:
//     Portuguese users had no /from/portugal page on any of five products.
//     An ancestor's CORRECT self-exclusion became every descendant's silent gap.
//
// Why a noun grep, a self check and a duplicate check ALL miss #2: the bug is an
// ABSENCE. Nothing is misspelled, duplicated or mislabelled — a row simply is not
// there. So this gate does not merely look for bad rows; it asserts the EXACT
// expected set: every country in the axis, minus this product's own.
//
// Flag emoji encode ISO-3166 alpha-2 (regional indicators U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF → A..Z),
// which makes every row self-checking regardless of what its name/slug claim.
//
// Porting to a new fork: change SELF_ISO. Nothing else is product-specific.

import { join } from "node:path";

const SELF_ISO = "CH"; // this product's own country — never a valid origin of itself

// The full country axis shared by the family (197). Any deviation is a bug:
// a MISSING code silently denies that origin's users their pages; an EXTRA code
// means a row was invented or renamed.
