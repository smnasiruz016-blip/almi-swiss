// Build-time FORK HYGIENE GATE — the AlmiWorld §7 rule, enforced instead of trusted.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. This repo's lineage is:
//   almi-celpip → almi-goethe → almi-icelandic → almi-danish → almi-norwegian → almi-swedish
// and every hop leaked the previous country's facts into user-facing copy. Real
// examples found live in production, not hypotheticals:
//   • almi-norwegian shipped `DK_UNIS = "the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus
//     University and other NORWEGIAN universities"` — Danish universities asserted
//     as Norwegian, on roughly a third of the study matrix.
//   • It cited "the Norwegian Patient Safety Authority, Styrelsen for
//     Patientsikkerhed" — Denmark's regulator — telling healthcare applicants to
//     seek authorisation from the wrong country's authority.
//   • It named "the University of Southern Norway", a FABRICATED institution
//     produced by find-replacing "Denmark"→"Norway" in "University of Southern
//     Denmark".
//   • Its listening module called ttsLang() → "is-IS": every Norwegian transcript
//     read aloud in an ICELANDIC voice, inherited from almi-icelandic.
//
// The lesson: a grep for the previous country's nouns is NOT enough, because the
// dangerous cases are the ones where the LABEL was localized and the FACT was not
// ("...and other Norwegian universities" passes a "Norway" grep). So this gate
// bans the ancestors' proper nouns outright — any occurrence is a leak, since a
// Swedish product has no reason to name Norwegian exams or Danish agencies.
//
// Runs before the build and FAILS it on any hit. If a future fork descends from
// this repo, update BANNED to add Swedish nouns and keep the ancestors listed.
