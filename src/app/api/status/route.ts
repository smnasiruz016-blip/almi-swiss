// verified before Neon is wired (dbError is surfaced honestly instead).

// this product's uptime and item counts would have been reported as the Swedish  hygiene-allow
// product's — two products claiming one identity, and the monitor believing the last
// one it polled. Same class of bug as metadata.product in lib/billing/stripe.ts.
