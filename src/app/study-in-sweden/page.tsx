          Whatever you plan to study in Sweden, the step students most often underestimate is the
          Swedish-language requirement. Many master&apos;s programmes are taught in English, but a
          Swedish-taught degree asks you to document your Swedish — and Tisus (≈C1), run by
          Stockholms universitet, is the established route. Choose a field to see the language
          pathway, and practise honestly for the Swedish exams — the SFI courses, general Swedish
          B1–B2 and Tisus.
