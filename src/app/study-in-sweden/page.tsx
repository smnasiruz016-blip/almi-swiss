          Whatever you plan to study in Norway, the step students most often underestimate is the
          Norwegian-language requirement — Norwegian-taught programmes typically expect around B2, and the
          Bergenstesten is a common gateway for Norwegian-taught programmes. Choose a field to see the language pathway
          and practise honestly for the Norwegian exams — the Norskprøven ladder and Bergenstesten.
