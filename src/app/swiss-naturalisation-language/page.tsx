  {
    q: "What is Medborgarskapsprovet?",
    a: "It is Sweden's new citizenship test. Under rules in force since 6 June 2026, applicants for Swedish citizenship aged 16–66 must demonstrate knowledge of Swedish society and of Swedish. UHR (Universitets- och högskolerådet) develops, administers and marks the test; Migrationsverket assesses citizenship applications and instructs applicants to register. So far only the society component exists.",
  },
  {
    q: "What score do I need to pass?",
    a: "UHR has not published a pass mark. Nobody can honestly tell you what it is, and anyone who quotes you a number is guessing. The test is new: the first sitting, on 15 August 2026, is an utprövningsprov — a pilot — and it is free of charge. Check UHR for the current details rather than trusting a third party's figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a Swedish language test for citizenship?",
    a: "Not yet. A language component is planned, but UHR indicates it cannot be ready before autumn 2028 at the earliest, and no CEFR level has been set for it. We do not sell practice for it, because there is nothing published to practise against. Building your Swedish on the SFI/CEFR ladder helps you either way — but it is not the citizenship language test, and we will not pretend otherwise.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the society test cover, and what format is it?",
    a: "UHR describes the test provisionally as around 60 multiple-choice questions with four options each, in about 90 minutes, in Swedish and on paper. The content comes from UHR's own free study material, Sverige i fokus, which covers 13 areas of Swedish society — from how Sweden is governed and how elections work to law and rights, the labour market, welfare, modern history, media, religion and traditions. The format is provisional and may change before the test is established.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is passing the test enough for citizenship?",
    a: "No — it is one requirement, not the whole application. Since 6 June 2026 the main rule for habitual residence is eight years, and there is a self-sufficiency requirement as well. There are no transitional arrangements: Migrationsverket assesses cases not decided before 6 June 2026 under the new rules. Only Migrationsverket can tell you which conditions apply to your situation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AlmiSwedish help — and is it official?",
    a: "It is not official. AlmiSwedish is not affiliated with UHR, and UHR has said plainly that it does not stand behind unofficial practice tests found online and that their quality is not checked by UHR. That includes ours. Our questions are original practice written against the same 13 society areas Sverige i fokus covers; they are not UHR's question bank, and no score here is an official result. Use UHR's free material as your source of truth and use us to find your gaps.",
