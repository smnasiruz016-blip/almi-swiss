// RR-397/RR-399 · how many AI scorings of a kind this account already RECEIVED: a successful ledger row is written only after the
// model answered. ONE count, read by the AI route (/api/ch/grade, for the 1-free rule) and by the exam page (for the honest badge),
// so the two can never disagree. The race between two requests is closed by the atomic FreeAiUse claim, not by this count.
