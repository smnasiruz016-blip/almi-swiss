// AlmiSwiss scoring engine — per-skill READINESS estimate.
//
// Nothing here may produce an official result, and for Switzerland that matters in
// two distinct ways:
//   • fide and the recognised certificates are assessed against official criteria by
//     a test centre. We are not one.
//   • Canton civic content has NO published pass mark anywhere, because there is no
//     national test to publish one — cantons and communes each decide. Inventing a
//     threshold there would fabricate the very test we say does not exist.
// So we grade objective items deterministically to a percentage, map that to an
// honest readiness band, and label productive skills (Writing/Speaking) as AI
// estimates. Every readout is an orientation estimate, never a result.
