// Origin-localization resolver — the enforcement seam for the AlmiWorld pSEO
// Localization Standard (rules #1, #2, #4).
//
// Every study/jobs/migration page MUST weave a per-origin block. This resolver
// returns EITHER the verified facts from the shared @smnasiruz016-blip/almi-data
// layer, OR an honest-generic fallback (never a name-swap, never an invented
// body). Because the generator's builders REQUIRE an OriginBlock and render a
// dedicated origin section from it, a bare name-swap template is structurally
// impossible — and the build-time uniqueness gate fails the build if any page
// still comes out near-identical to another.
