// AlmiSwedish — the "Choose a Test" tree + exam metadata.
// Four goal-based tracks → exams → skills. Drives navigation, content filtering,
// and the honest readiness thresholds used by the scoring engine. All "pass"
// figures are framed as READINESS estimates, never an official UHR result.
//
// FACT BASE (verified 2026-07; re-check before editing any claim here):
//   • Law in force 6 June 2026: habitual residence 5 → 8 years, a self-sufficiency
//     requirement, and Medborgarskapsprovet mandatory for ages 16–66. No
//     transitional arrangements — Migrationsverket assesses undecided cases under
//     the new rules.
//   • UHR develops/administers/marks the test. Migrationsverket assesses
//     applications and instructs applicants to register.
//   • SOCIETY component only. First sitting 15 Aug 2026 at Stockholmsmässan is an
//     *utprövningsprov* (pilot), free of charge. Provisional format per UHR: ~60
//     four-option MCQ, 90 minutes, Swedish, on paper, from UHR's "Sverige i fokus".
//     PASS MARK NOT PUBLISHED.
//   • LANGUAGE component: UHR indicates autumn 2028 at the earliest; no CEFR level
//     set. We ship NO practice for it. Do not add one until UHR publishes a spec.
//   • Tisus: Stockholms universitet, ≈C1, for Swedish-taught university admission.
//   • SFI: courses A–D over 3 study paths. Skolverket maps A/B ≈ A1–A2, C/D ≈
//     B1/B1+. The SFI scale is NOT CEFR — always say "approximately".
//   • Swedex is excluded: it cannot be taken after 31 Dec 2026.
